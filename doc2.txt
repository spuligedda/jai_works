Documentation: Single-Page Login Interface
Overview
This is a single-page login interface designed to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing experience. The page includes a header with a logo and title, a login form, a footer with social media links, and interactive functionality for "Forgot Password" and "Login" actions.

Code Breakdown
1. HTML Structure
The HTML structure is divided into four main sections:

a) <head> Section
Contains the meta information, title of the page, and embedded styles.
Includes a <style> block for defining the CSS styles.
Includes a <script> block for JavaScript functionality.
b) <header>
Displays the logo and page title.
Positioned at the top of the page and styled to stay fixed during scrolling.
The logo is displayed on the left, and the title is aligned to the center.
c) Login Form
Includes:
A h2 heading with the text Login to Your Account.
Input fields for Username and Password.
A "Forgot Password?" link.
A Login button to submit the form.
d) Thank You Message
Hidden by default.
Displayed after the user submits the login form.
e) Footer
Contains links to YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn with original icons.
Positioned at the bottom of the page and styled for a consistent layout.
2. CSS Styling
The design is controlled by a combination of CSS properties:

General Body Styling
Center-aligned page layout with a light background color (#f0f0f5).
Font-family set to Arial for consistency.
Header
A fixed header bar styled with:
Background color: #4CAF50 (green).
White text color.
Flexbox alignment for positioning the logo and title.
Login Form
The form is styled as a card with:
Rounded corners (border-radius: 10px).
Shadow for depth (box-shadow).
Centered alignment and a clean white background.
Input fields are styled for:
Proper spacing and a clean look with rounded edges.
Button styles:
Green background matching the header (#4CAF50).
White text and hover effect for interactivity.
Footer
Positioned at the bottom using position: fixed.
Displays social media icons with uniform size.
3. JavaScript Functionality
Two key functions are implemented using JavaScript:

a) handleForgotPassword
Triggered when the user clicks "Forgot Password".
Uses prompt() to display a dialog asking for the user's email.
Displays:
A success message if an email is entered.
A warning if the user clicks "Cancel" or leaves the input empty.
b) handleLogin
Triggered when the login form is submitted.
Prevents the default form submission behavior using event.preventDefault().
Hides the login form and displays a thank-you message.
4. Social Media Links
Each link (<a> tag) in the footer directs to its respective website (YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn).
Original icons are used via <img> tags:
Icons are sourced from publicly available URLs.
Images are resized to ensure uniformity.
5. Layout & Responsiveness

Fixed header ensures consistent navigation visibility.
The form is centered and adapts to different screen widths.
